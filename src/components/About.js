      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A final year student at New Horizon College of Engineering who is
        passionate about Cybersecurity, AIML and Web Development. With the skills I have gained
        through my coursework and personal projects, I am eager to contribute to
        the society and put them in good use. Apart from my technical skills, I
        am a quick learner and a team player, always ready to take on new
        challenges. I am currently seeking internship opportunities to further
        enhance my skills and gain practical experience.
