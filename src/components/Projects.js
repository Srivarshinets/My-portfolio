        <h3>Yoga Mudra Detection using AI/ML</h3>
        <p>
          This project detects a yoga mudra real time and displays the accuracy.
          The libraries used in here is opencv, numpy, tensorflow. We are still
          working on this project to make it into a web app.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation of Image Classification using ML Model</h3>
        <p>
          This project is about making a ML model for classifying an image using
          the technologies such as tensorflow, keras, numpy.
